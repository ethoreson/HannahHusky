					<h3>My Husky Story</h3>
					<p>This year Professor Christina Fong asked me to take part in a Fail Forward Panel in front of a 200-student sized lecture for her Leadership class that I’m assisting in this quarter. While slightly off-putting, I jumped at the chance for some intense self-reflection and the challenge of sharing my story with 200 strangers. I have always had a “yes” attitude when new challenges or opportunities come my way. Life is so much more fun the more involved you are, especially when you're doing what you love. This was the same attitude I had coming into UW. I was determined to become active in new-found communities.</p>
					<p>This task was not as easy as I initially thought. Throughout my first year, I was incredibly frustrated with the amount of failure and rejection I encountered. I wanted to find new communities that I could dive into head-first, but was unprepared for receiving my first real rejections. I studied the UW RSO registry. I stopped at every booth I saw on campus. High school leadership was how I found my love for involvement and activism so I applied to the clubs that I identified with most: Greek Leaders, UW Leaders, Campus Tour Guides, etc. After numerous rejections, I started to question my identity as a leader and my self-worth. As frustrated as I was, I pushed through and kept trying to get involved. There had to be opportunities out there for me and I was going to find them. When I saw an advertisement for a four-day leadership retreat that wanted to create change within the Greek Community, I was ecstatic. The three pillars of the program are leadership development, building friendships across the community, and honest dialogue about the flaws of the community. While it was intimidating to apply after feeling so unqualified, my desire to seek change in my community pushed me forward.</p>
					<p>Now it’s two years later and I am the Director of the RSO and leading the preparation for the club’s fourth annual retreat in March 2018. I have since found myself involved in the Husky Experience Student Advisory Committee, Dream Project, Pipeline, the FIG program, New Member Education program for my sorority, and Christina Fong’s “Learning Leadership in Theory and Practice” class and still encountering failure. I’ve thought back to my initial decision to apply for the Greek Community Project retreat and how close I was to not applying because I expected rejection. It’s funny to look back, because I no longer fear rejection, I learn from it. I have become a more resilient person. I also know that this application was so important to me, because it was about creating change within my community, a change I knew was necessary after only a quarter into my experience. Even after continuous rejections, I couldn’t let my self-doubt stop me from trying to change my community for the better.</p>

					<h3>ReWa and Pipeline</h3>
					<p>Days after Trump’s Muslim ban, I noticed an ad for Refuegee Women's Alliance (ReWA). I discovered I could volunteer to help a community that was being egregiously attacked. I started volunteering in an after-school program at Maple Elementary and I was blown away by the creativity, engagement, and determination these students show. Pipeline gave me the opportunity to reflect on how my presence impacted the students I volunteered with. Additionally, I was able to participate in deeper conversations about modern social justice issues. After the first few weeks of Pipeline I was able to better understand my role as a white woman in a position of power with young children of immigrants.</p>

					<h3>Dream Project</h3>
					<img src="images/dream1.jpg" alt="DREAM team picture" class="pic" id="dream1">
					<p>Through Dream Project I have been able to help juniors and seniors with the college application process including navigating CADRs, SAT prep, financial aid, and personal statements. The classes cover a lot about social justice issues from Black Lives Matter to DACA and how they could be impacting my mentees. My involvement with Dream Project has helped me grow as a person and better understand the complexities of both the college application process and the added challenges to students who are first generation college students and don’t always have someone to help them navigate the process.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>FIG</h3>

					<p>I am especially proud of my work as a FIG Leader. After being too unsure of myself to apply during my first year, I finally had the confidence to apply for it my Sophomore year. I was incredibly nervous throughout the whole application process, but it was worth it.</p>
					<p>I have always been passionate about mentoring so I felt completely in my element being able to aid UW freshmen in their college transition. I shared my trials and missteps and gave them insider tips on registration, UW’s large campus, and finding the RSOs that are right for them. It was very rewarding to be able to help them find their place and feel more at home at UW.</p>

					<h3>Greek Community Project</h3>
					<img src="images/sk2.jpg" alt="sigma kappa group pic 2" class="pic" id="sk2">
					<p>I was so eager to join the Greek Community and find life-long friends and sisterhood, and while I have received more love and support than I could have imagined, there are still significant flaws within the community. Attending (and later leading) the GCP Retreat helped remind me of the strength of our community. We have passionate members who want to make us a more inclusive community. As New Member Educator for my sorority I made it my mission to provide more space for critical dialogue about our community’s flaws in order to help prevent normalizing the unhealthy cultures the community consistently reproduces. When my frustration with the Community came to its height in the spring of last year I thought about leaving the community and I reached out to my mentor from GCP who told me I could either leave and complain about it or I could stay and fix it from the inside. I’ve taken her words to heart and do what I can every day to hold my community members accountable to be better neighbors, better friends, and better Huskies.</p>
